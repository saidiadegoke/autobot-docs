# Instructions for Installation

### Save the Script:

### Make the Script Executable:
Run the following command to make the script executable.

```bash
chmod +x install_docs.sh
```

### Run the Script:
Execute the script using:

```bash
./install_docs.sh
```

### What the Script Does:
- Creates the entire `docs/` directory structure for Autobot Candidate, Admin, and Server documentation.
- Creates the necessary subdirectories such as `test-taker-documentation/`, `exam-center-documentation/`, `developer-documentation/`, and others.
- Creates the corresponding markdown files like `overview.md`, `system-requirements.md`, etc.

After running this script, you'll have the entire folder structure and empty markdown files prepared for your Docusaurus-based documentation site.

# Instructions for Uninstallation

### How the Script Works:

1. **Remove Individual Files**:  
   The script will go through the specific directories and files created by `install_docs.sh` and remove them using the `rm -f` command.
   
   - If the file exists, it is removed; if not, the script continues without error.

2. **Remove Directories**:  
   After removing the files, the script attempts to remove the directories using the `rmdir` command.
   
   - The `rmdir` command only removes the directory if it is empty, so directories containing other content will not be deleted.
   - `2>/dev/null` suppresses any errors if the directory is not empty or doesn't exist, ensuring a clean output.

3. **Directory Structure**:  
   The script works independently for each section (`autobot-candidate`, `autobot-admin`, `autobot-server`), ensuring that only the files and directories created by `install_docs.sh` are deleted.

### Instructions to Use:

1. **Save the Script**:  
   Save the code into a file named `uninstall_docs.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable**:
   Run the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x uninstall_docs.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   Execute the script using:

   ```bash
   ./uninstall_docs.sh
   ```
