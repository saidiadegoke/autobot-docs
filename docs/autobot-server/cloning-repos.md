# Cloning the Autobot Server Repositories

To set up the Autobot server environment, you'll need to clone both the frontend and backend repositories from Bitbucket. Follow the steps below to clone the necessary repositories.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- **Git**: Make sure Git is installed on your machine. You can download it from [Git's official website](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

- **Access to the Repositories**: Ensure you have the appropriate permissions to access the Bitbucket repositories.

## Cloning the Repositories

### Step 1: Open a Terminal

Open a terminal window on your machine. You can do this by searching for "Terminal" in your applications.

### Step 2: Navigate to Your Desired Directory

Use the `cd` command to navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repositories. For example:

```bash
cd ~/projects
```

### Step 3: Clone the Frontend Repository

Run the following command to clone the Autobot server frontend repository:

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:morgengreen1/autobot-server-frontend.git
```

### Step 4: Clone the Backend Repository

Next, run the following command to clone the Autobot server backend repository:

```bash
git clone git@bitbucket.org:morgengreen1/autobot-server-backend.git
```

### Step 5: Verify the Cloning Process

After running the above commands, you should see two new directories: `autobot-server-frontend` and `autobot-server-backend`. You can list the contents of your current directory to confirm:

```bash
ls
```

You should see both cloned repositories listed.
