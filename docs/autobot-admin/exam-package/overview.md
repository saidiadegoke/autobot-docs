### How These Components Work Together

1. **Controller Layer**:
   - Controllers like `ExamController`, `ExamControllerClient`, and `ExamControllerSocket` are responsible for handling HTTP and WebSocket requests related to the lifecycle of an exam session.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - `ExamService`, `ExamServiceImpl`, and `ExamServiceMemoryImpl` provide business logic for creating, managing, and monitoring exam sessions. They interact with the repository layer to perform operations related to exam data.

3. **Repository Layer**:
   - `ExamSessionRepository`, `ExamSessionNodeRepository`, and `ExamDefaultRepository` are responsible for interacting with the database to perform CRUD operations on exam sessions, nodes, and default exam settings.

4. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:
   - DTOs such as `NewExamRequestDTO`, `ExamSessionDTO`, and `SubmitAnswerRequestDTO` act as intermediaries for transferring data between the client, service, and repository layers. These DTOs ensure standardized data exchange across different layers.

5. **Enums**:
   - Enums like `ExamStatusEnum`, `ExamNodeStatusEnum`, and `SubmitInstructionsEnum` ensure consistent representation of statuses and instructions throughout the system, improving maintainability and reducing errors.
