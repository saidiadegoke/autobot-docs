### Structure Overview of `clientnode` Package

The `clientnode` package shown in the image represents the functionality within the **AutoBot Admin** application related to managing **client nodes**. Client nodes could be machines connected to the admin system, such as candidate computers, and their interactions with the server are managed through this package. This package includes various components like controllers, services, repositories, and DTOs for communication between client nodes and the admin system.

Below is a detailed breakdown of each component in the `clientnode` package:

---

### 1. **ClientNodeController**
   - **Type**: Spring MVC Controller (`@RestController`)
   - **Purpose**: Handles incoming HTTP requests related to **client nodes** and their interactions with the server.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Manage client node registration and connection to the server.
     - Handle requests related to client node status, health checks, and connection management.

### 2. **ClientNodeEntity**
   - **Type**: JPA Entity (`@Entity`)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the client node as a database entity. This is the object that is mapped to a table in the database and holds client node data.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Store client node details such as connection status, IP address, or other relevant metadata.
     - Support persistence operations through the repository layer.

### 3. **ClientNodeRepository**
   - **Type**: Spring Data JPA Repository (`@Repository`)
   - **Purpose**: Provides an abstraction layer for performing CRUD operations on client node data in the database.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Interact with the `ClientNodeEntity` to perform database operations such as saving, updating, or retrieving node data.

### 4. **ClientNodeService**
   - **Type**: Service Interface
   - **Purpose**: Defines the operations that can be performed on client nodes. The service layer handles business logic related to managing client nodes and their interaction with the server.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Define methods to handle the registration, connection, and status management of client nodes.
     - Specify business rules for handling nodes, such as health checks or connection verification.

### 5. **ClientNodeServiceImpl**
   - **Type**: Service Implementation (`@Service`)
   - **Purpose**: Provides the concrete implementation of the `ClientNodeService` interface. This is where the actual business logic for managing client nodes resides.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Implement methods to handle node registration, status checks, health monitoring, and more.
     - Call the `ClientNodeRepository` to perform database operations and return data to the controller.

### 6. **ConnectedNodesCounterDTO**
   - **Type**: Data Transfer Object (DTO)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the count or summary of nodes connected to the server at any given time.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Encapsulate the count of currently connected nodes or other summary metrics that are transferred between the client node service and the admin dashboard.

### 7. **ConnectToServerRequestDTO**
   - **Type**: Data Transfer Object (DTO)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the data structure for a request from a client node to connect to the server. This object holds the necessary information for the client node to initiate a connection.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Encapsulate data such as node ID, IP address, or credentials needed to connect a node to the server.

### 8. **ConnectToServerResponseDTO**
   - **Type**: Data Transfer Object (DTO)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the response structure for a successful connection request from a client node to the server.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Provide feedback to the client node after attempting to connect to the server, including confirmation of successful connection or failure messages.

### 9. **NodeStatusesEnum**
   - **Type**: Enum
   - **Purpose**: Defines the various statuses a client node can have, such as "Connected", "Disconnected", or "In Error".
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Serve as a standard way of representing and managing node statuses across different parts of the application (controller, service, and repository).
     - Ensure consistency in how node statuses are checked, updated, and stored.

### 10. **PulseCheckDTO**
   - **Type**: Data Transfer Object (DTO)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the health check or pulse status of a client node. It likely contains information about the health, performance, or connectivity status of a node.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Encapsulate data about the health of the node, such as response times, connectivity status, and overall performance metrics.

### 11. **RDPClientDTO**
   - **Type**: Data Transfer Object (DTO)
   - **Purpose**: Represents a client node using the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). It likely holds configuration or status information specific to RDP clients.
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Encapsulate RDP-specific client node details like IP address, connection status, and protocol configuration.

### 12. **ThinClientDBResult**
   - **Type**: Data Transfer Object (DTO)
   - **Purpose**: Represents the result or status of a database query or operation related to a "thin client" (a lightweight client that relies on a server for most processing).
   - **Key Responsibilities**:
     - Encapsulate the results of operations performed on thin clients, such as connection status, database query results, or other client-related information.

### How These Components Work Together

1. **Controller Layer**:
   - `ClientNodeController` is responsible for handling HTTP requests related to client nodes, such as registering nodes, checking connection statuses, and performing health checks.

2. **Service Layer**:
   - `ClientNodeService` and `ClientNodeServiceImpl` provide the business logic for client nodes. They ensure that the nodes are connected, monitored, and updated as needed. The service layer also interacts with the repository to perform database operations.

3. **Repository Layer**:
   - `ClientNodeRepository` interacts with the database to perform CRUD operations on the client nodes stored in the database. It abstracts database interactions, allowing the service to focus on business logic.

4. **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**:
   - DTOs like `ConnectToServerRequestDTO`, `ConnectToServerResponseDTO`, and `PulseCheckDTO` act as intermediaries that allow data to flow between the server and the client node. These objects decouple the internal database or logic structure from the external API by ensuring a standardized format for data transmission.

5. **Enum**:
   - `NodeStatusesEnum` provides a consistent set of statuses that are used across the application to represent the state of a client node. This ensures consistency and readability when dealing with client node statuses.
