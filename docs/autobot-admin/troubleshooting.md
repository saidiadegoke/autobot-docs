# Troubleshooting

The error message you're seeing indicates that the Maven compiler plugin is trying to use the `--release` flag, which is not supported by the Java compiler version you have installed. Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

### Steps to Fix the Issue

1. **Verify Your Java Version**:
   Ensure that you are using Java 11 since the `maven.compiler.source`, `maven.compiler.target`, and `maven.compiler.release` settings should match this version. You can check your Java version with the following command:
   ```bash
   java --version
   ```

2. **Update Maven Compiler Plugin Configuration**:
   Your current configuration is likely using a `release` flag that is not compatible with your installed JDK version. Change your Maven compiler plugin settings to avoid using the `release` flag. Hereâ€™s how to adjust your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <build>
       <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
               <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>3.8.1</version>
               <configuration>
                   <source>11</source>  <!-- Ensure this matches your Java version -->
                   <target>11</target>  <!-- Ensure this matches your Java version -->
                   <compilerArgs>
                       <arg>-Xlint:unchecked</arg>
                       <arg>-Xlint:deprecation</arg>
                   </compilerArgs>
               </configuration>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
   </build>
   ```

   Make sure **not** to include the `<maven.compiler.release>` setting, as this can trigger the invalid flag issue if the wrong JDK is being used.

3. **Clean Your Maven Environment**:
   After making changes to your `pom.xml`, it's good practice to clean your Maven project:
   ```bash
   mvn clean
   ```

4. **Rebuild the Project**:
   Now try to build your project again:
   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```

### Additional Considerations
- **Check for Multiple JDKs**: If you have multiple JDK versions installed on your machine, make sure your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable points to the correct JDK 11 installation.
- **IDE Configuration**: If you are using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ or Eclipse, ensure that the project settings are also set to use JDK 11.
- **Maven Version**: Ensure that you are using a compatible version of Maven that works well with JDK 11. You are currently using Maven 3.9.2, which should be fine.

Consider checking the output of the `mvn -v` command and see if the java version is as expected.
